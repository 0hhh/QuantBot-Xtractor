# üìà QuantBot-Xtractor: Real-Time Market Intelligence Pipeline

## Project Overview

**QuantBot-Xtractor** is a specialized system designed for the quantitative analysis of public market sentiment related to the Indian stock market.
Extracting Market Sentiment Signals from Twitter for Quantitative Trading.

### Core Objectives

1.  **Data Collection:** Efficiently scrape 2000+ tweets related to **#nifty50**, **#sensex**, **#banknifty**, and **#intraday** within a 24-hour window, bypassing API restrictions through a robust, unofficial scraping solution.
2.  **Data Pipeline:** Implement a scalable, memory-efficient processing pipeline for cleaning, deduplication, and storage using the Parquet format.
3.  **Signal Generation:** Convert textual data and engagement metrics into actionable, quantitative trading signals using **TF-IDF** and a custom **Financial Lexicon Sentiment Model**.
4.  **Software Quality:** Ensure production-readiness with proper logging, error handling, documentation, and the use of concurrent processing (`asyncio`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

| Component | Technology / Library | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | Python 3.10+ | Standard for Data Science and Quant development. |
| **Scraping** | `[Placeholder: e.g., snscrape / Playwright]` | Chosen for robust, non-API data extraction from X/Twitter, handling anti-bot measures creatively. |
| **Concurrency** | `asyncio`, `concurrent.futures` | Optimizes I/O-bound tasks (scraping) and CPU-bound tasks (analysis). |
| **Data Handling** | `Pandas`, `NumPy` | Core libraries for efficient data manipulation and numerical operations. |
| **NLP/ML** | `scikit-learn`, `nltk` | Used for TF-IDF vectorization and text feature engineering. |
| **Storage** | `pyarrow` (Parquet) | Chosen for high-performance, columnar storage, ideal for analytical queries. |
